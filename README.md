The graphical programming consists in creating images/animations and scenes management using algorithms and graphical resources.

This unit aims to initiate you into this domain and, in a medium run, to prepare yourself to the main issues of the MyRPG, which is the main project of this unit at the end of the year. 
The two important axis of such a project are:
1 - Graphical special effects generation, 2D/3D rendering, collision management, entity management, etc. being part of the mathematical component.
2 - Gameplay, animations with sprites, virtual world coherence, lifespan of the game, etc. everything enhancing the "game" aspect.

For the first unit, the projects of the mathematics axis are:
    - MyHunter: Game with a fixed camera, in which the player can shoot in some moving elements.
    - MyRunner: Game with a scrolling camera in which the character must stay, while dodging obstacles.

You will use the CSFML, a multimedia librairie developped in C.

Compétences à acquérir
Gaming projects
- Resources, Event, and Windows management.
- Persistent data storing (e.g. highscore, or progression)
- Simple starting and pause menus
- Implementation of gameplay mechanics
- Implementation of simple game physics mechanics
- Famous visual effects (e.g. parallax)

Mathematics
- Frames and windows management
- Drawing (simple and complex) shapes with a pixel drawing function.
- Implementation of simple tricks to render complex visual effects.
- Entity management
- Implementation of simple collision algorithm (hitbox)
- Optimisation techniques to render and manage large numbers of entities.

This unit aim to go further into the skills in this domain and to synthetise your experience onto a final project: MyRPG
The two prior axis "mathematics" and "game" are still to be, but a new UX/UI-oriented aspect emerges.

The projects has been done in groups.

For the second unit, the project of the mathematics axis is:
The MyDefender : this project is a Tower Defense game.
The MyRPG project is the final project of the unit. The objective is to create a complete adventure game with a progressing experience.

You will be provided the CSFML, a multimedia librairie developped in C.
